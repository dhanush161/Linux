yum is a front-end tool for package management that automatically resolves dependencies.(can resolve the dependencies)
while rpm is a lowet-level tool that manages individual packages without automatically handling dependencies.(cannot resolve the dependencies)
apt list --installed(Debian/Ubuntu),rpm -qa(RHEL/CentOS)-->list all instsalled packages using package manager.

sudo cat /etc/fstab,cat /etc/fstab-->System configuration file
Logical Volume Manager(LVM) allows for flexible disk management by creating,resizing & deleting logical volumes.
A simple script can be created using a text editor,starts with shebang line(#!/bin/bash for bash script) follow shell commmands.
The script file should be executable with chmod +x scriptname
Eg..> $vi test.sh-> ctrl+i-Insert mode #!/bin/bash & next line-> echo HELLO after :wq (Save & quit).
There is two ways to execute the script: $bash test.sh,output is HELLO and $chmod +x test.sh,$./test.sh,output is HELLO.

Eg.-> dd(allocate space),mkswap(to set up space area),swapon(enable swap file)
The /etc/hosts file is used to map hostanames to IP address.
Eg.->sudo cat /etc/hosts,cat /etc/hosts
Static Ip address is set by editing network configuration files or using network management tools or commands,depending on the distribution.
Eg.-> nmcli
nslookup is a network administration command line tool used for querying the DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.
iptables is a traditional form of linux firewall & firewalld is a more dynamic,frontend friendly tool that interfaces with iptables configuration\

Eg.->sudo dmidecode|more (use this cmd get BIOS information & get more memory space allocation).
Runlevels are predefined modes that a linux system can run in each with a specific purpose like single-user mode,multi-user mode,GUI mode etc.check using runlevel command.
*Runlevel 0:Halt/Shut down the system-->poweroff.target 
*Runlevel 1:Single User Mode-->rescue.target
*Runlevel 2:Multi-user Mode without Networking-->multi-user.target with modern distributions,networking is started at all multi-user runlevels
*Runlevel 3:Multi-user Mode with Networking-->mutli-user.target
*Runlevel 4:User-Defined/Spare-->multi-user.target as well typically not used & available for custom configurations
*Runlevel 5:Full multi-user mode(with Network graphical user interface)-->graphical.target
*Runlevel 6:Reboot-->reboot.target
Eg.-> $runlevel and output is N 5
Runlevels can be changed using the init/telinit command for systemctl in systemd-based systems.
The /boot directory contains essential files needed to boot the system,including the linux kernel,initial RAM disk images & the bootloader configuration.
rsync is used for fast and versatile file copying,both locally & remotely.It's commonly used for backups and mirroring.
A Linux Distribution is a version of the operating system that includes the Linux kernel,a pkg management system & other supporting software & libraries.
popular Linux Distribution includes Ubuntu,Fedora,CentOS,Debian,Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL) & openSUSE.
The hostname can be changed using the hostnamectl command or by editing /etc/hostname.
System logs record various of the operating system.They are typically located in the /var/log directory.
netstat is used to display network connections,routing tables,interface statistics,masquerade connections & multicast memberships.
How to you add a new disk to a linux system withhout rebooting:
*Scan the SCSI bus using commands like echo "---">/sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
*Partitioning(ex/dev/sdb using fdisk)
*Formatting the new disk(using mkfs)
*Mount

Ccommon Network configuration files includes /etc/network/interfaces(Debian/Ubuntu),/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0(RHEL/CentOS) & /etc/netplan/*.yaml(newer Ubuntu versions).
Eg.-> $cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-rh.txt
$cat /etc/sysconfig/,[sysconfig]#cd network-scripts/,[network-scripts]#ls output is readme-ifcfg-rh.txt,[network-scripts]#less readme-ifcfg-rh.txt
The default runlevel can be changed by editing the /etc/inittab file in SysVinit systems or by using systemctl set-default in systemd systems.
Eg.-> [network-scripts]#systemctl get-default & output is graphical.target

whereas service is a process that performs a specific function and may not run continously.
Output redirected using > for standard output & 2> standard error.
/proc is a virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism to access kernel & process information in a file-like structure.
tr is used for translating or deleting characters from standard input and writing to standard output.
